Jenkins Architechture


Nodes:
    Prerequisites:
        * An Instance with password Authentication enabled
        * tmp space should be around 1.5 - 2GB 
    Challenges we've:
        Enable PasswordAuthentication:
            * In Azure, you can have the option to go for PasswordAuthentication by your choice
            * In AWS, by default, we cant get PasswordAuthentication enabled option. Following is the process to enable PasswordAuthentication enabled
                * see the status: systemctl status sshd
                * vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config (Enable "password Authentication and root login" to yes in the file "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file)
                    PermitRootLogin yes
                    PasswordAuthentication yes
                * Restart the sshd service
                    systemctl restart sshd
                * Set the password for the root user
                    If you're currently in root user. following is the command 
                        passwd
