1. VPC




VPC:
    * Why Private networks are needed? 
        IPV4 - 32 bits i.e., 4 Octets 
             - N.of IPs = 2 ^ 32 = 4 Billion + Ips
             - Population = 8 Billion 

        Reasons: 
        ~ Not enough IPs to assign for all the People as all the IPs will be exhausted at some point
        ~ Companies would like to have Private IPs as much as Possible as they dont want to make everything Pulic

    * CIDR Ranges: 
        * We will have to decide how many IPs we need?
        * When creating a Private network, we have two parts in IPV4 (32 bits)
            1. Network bits 
            2. Host bits 

            0.0.0.0     -- Network Bits allocation & Host Bits  
            -------
                32 
            
            First 2 Octets cant be used - so, they are for Network Bits - Bare minimum req - 2^16 IPs = 65536 Ips

            VPC: 10.0.0.0/16
                    3rd octet: 4 bits to n/w  and the other 4 are for host

    * Subnets:
        Why are these necessary? 
            * To hide some of the servers like DB from the Outer world
        * There are 2 types of Subnets
            1. Private Subnet
            2. Public Subnet
