* How commands & Installations actually work in an Operating system
    - OS will have a variable called PATH. PATH variable consists of Directories separated by a separator (: for linux and ; for windows)
    - Update the path Variable in the file
        * ~/.bashrc:                for linux
        * ~/.bash_profile:          for mac
        * environment variables:    for windows 

    - Type of Installations:
        * executable:   90% -- It itself sets the directory in the PATH variable. OR it sends the command file into any of the existing directories present in the PATH variable
        * Zip files:        -- we will have to set the directory in the path variable

* Type of Paths:
    * Relative Path:        Will refer the path according to the present working directory
    * absolute path:        Complete path

* Pipe:
    <command-1>  | <command-2>


* Password less communication
    - Generate the ssh keys in the local machine if not present
        * ssh-keygen -t rsa
            - interactive command

    - Copy the keys to the remote server to enable password less communication
        Default Keys:
            * ssh-copy-id -i <username>@<IP>
            * ssh-copy-id <username>@<IP> (mac)
                ~ Both the above commands are going to copy id_rsa.pub i.e., Publick key from the directory <user_home>/.ssh by default if we dont specify any key
            * connect to the machine like This
                ssh <username>@<IP>
                ~ it assumes the private key as  <user_home>/.ssh/id_rsa and connect to the machine

        User specified Keys:
            * ssh-copy-id -i <path_of_the_ssh_public_key> <username>@<IP> (same for linux and mac machine)
                ~ This command copies the public key specified in the command to the remote server
            * connect to the machine like this
                ~ ssh -i <corresponding private key file path of the public key mentioned while copying> <username>@<IP>


* Running the processes in Background
    * Putting the ambersand at the end of the command will make the command to run in background
        docker run -it --name my-running-app -p 8080:80 httpd &

* Miscellaneous:
    ~       - user home
    .       - present working directory
    ..      - parent directory to the present directory
    *       - all in the present working directory
    /       - takes you to the first most directory inside the filesystem
