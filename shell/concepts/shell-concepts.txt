* How commands & Installations actually work in an Operating system
    - OS will have a variable called PATH. PATH variable consists of Directories separated by a separator (: for linux and ; for windows)
    - Update the path Variable in the file
        * ~/.bashrc:                for linux
        * ~/.bash_profile:          for mac
        * environment variables:    for windows 

    - Type of Installations:
        * executable:   90% -- It itself sets the directory in the PATH variable. OR it sends the command file into any of the existing directories present in the PATH variable
        * Zip files:        -- we will have to set the directory in the path variable

* Type of Paths:
    * Relative Path:        Will refer the path according to the present working directory
    * absolute path:        Complete path

* Pipe:
    <command-1>  | <command-2>


* Password less communication
* Running the processes in Background


* Miscellaneous:
    ~       - user home
    .       - present working directory
    ..      - parent directory to the present directory
    *       - all in the present working directory
    /       - takes you to the first most directory inside the filesystem
